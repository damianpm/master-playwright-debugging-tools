# master-playwright-debugging-tools

This is the companion repository for my article *Master Playwright's Debugging Tools*.

## What is in the repo?

This repo was created with `npm init playwright@latest`, and then slightly modified.

It contains 2 test files, both automatically generated by Playwright:

* [demo-todo-app.spec.ts](tests/demo-todo-app.spec.ts)
* [example.spec.ts](tests/example.spec.ts):

Since the purpose of the article and this repository is to demonstrate how Playwright debugging tools work, these two simple test files are sufficient.

## How to use it?

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/damianpm/master-playwright-debugging-tools.git
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To explore the different debugging tools, follow the instructions in *Master Playwright's Debugging Tools*
